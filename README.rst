This package is part of a `refactoring of PySAL
<https://github.com/pysal/pysal/wiki/PEP-13:-Refactor-PySAL-Using-Submodules>`_.

--------------------------------------

Spaghetti is an open-source python library for the analysis of network-based spatial data. Originating from the ``network`` module in `PySAL (Python Spatial Analysis Library) <http://pysal.org>`_, it is under active development for the inclusion of newly proposed methods for building graph-theoretic networks and the analysis of network events.

-------------------------------

Examples
--------
* `Network Usage <https://github.com/pysal/spaghetti/blob/master/notebooks/Network_Usage.ipynb>`_
* `Spaghetti Pointpatterns Empirical <https://github.com/pysal/spaghetti/blob/master/notebooks/Spaghetti_Pointpatterns_Empirical.ipynb>`_
* `Snapping Demonstration <https://github.com/pysal/spaghetti/blob/master/notebooks/Snapping_Demonstration.ipynb>`_
