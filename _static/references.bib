  abstract = {This paper proposes two statistical methods, called the network K-function method and the network cross K-function method, for analyzing the distribution of points on a network. First, by extending the ordinary K-function method defined on a homogeneous infinite plane with the Euclidean distance, the paper formulates the K-function method and the cross K-function method on a finite irregular network with the shortest-path distance. Second, the paper shows advantages of the network K-function methods, such as that the network K-function methods can deal with spatial point processes on a street network in a small district, and that they can exactly take the boundary effect into account. Third, the paper develops the computational implementation of the network K-functions, and shows that the computational order of the K-function method is O(n2Q log nQ) and that of the network cross K-function is O(nQ log U3Q), where nQ is the number of nodes of a network.},

  abstract = {To accommodate network allocation, population polygons are frequently transformed into singular, weighted centroids which are then integrated into the network either by snapping each centroid to the nearest network segment or by generating an artificial connector that becomes part of the network. In this article, an investigation of the connection method of network allocation is undertaken with two primary foci: (1) how the density of centroid connectors effects travel cost along the network; and (2) how the algorithms utilized to determine the placement of connectors are affected by the density of connectors. We hypothesize that both issues have an effect on network travel cost and, therefore, on network-based modeling. These hypotheses are tested on three nested spatial networks in the New England region of the United States. Two fundamental facility location models, the p-median problem, and p-center problem, are solved at each spatial extent while varying the density of connectors from one to four. When generating more than one connector thought must be given to the method of connection, the angle of dispersion, the acceptable tolerance of connector length, segment crossing, and saturated connectivity. A novel and thorough framework is proposed to address these concerns.}

  abstract = {PySAL is a library for geocomputation and spatial data science. Written in Python, the library has a long history of supporting novel scholarship and broadening methodological impacts far afield of academic work. Recently, many new techniques, methods of analyses, and development modes have been implemented, making the library much larger and more encompassing than that previously discussed in the literature. As such, we provide an introduction to the library as it stands now, as well as the scientific and conceptual underpinnings of its core set of components. Finally, we provide a prospective look at the library's future evolution.}
